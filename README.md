## About
This is a project about a card game called "Dutch", it is a game that me and my friends play whenever we have a deck of cards. <br/>
It is a memory style game where each decision and action counts and makes for great moments of fun and sometimes can even turn friends into foes! <br/><br/>

And so I've decided to program this game to test myself and learn something new in the meanwhile.<br/>
I've always wanted to program games so I thought that this would be a great start. <br/>
At the time, I was learning some HTML/CSS/Javascript from The Odin Project (check them out -> https://www.theodinproject.com/) and decided to tackle this project the latter languages.

## Let's make a browser game!
My first attempt, or better yet a "draft", was a simple console variation of the game using only Javascript. <br/>
It was successful and I could play the game on the browser's console with simple inputs for commands, such as "1", "2", etc. <br/>
This version is still accessible if you visit the "dutch_prototype" branch. <br/>
